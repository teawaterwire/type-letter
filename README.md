# Type Letter

I just wanted to make a silly mini game with [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/)
to give [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/) a try. :bowtie:

This is a small app, but this was enough to convince me of the potential of such a technology (example: https://github.com/teawaterwire/type-letter/blob/master/src/cljs/type/core.cljs#L92). :raised_hands:

Had I tried to build the app without `channels` it would have been a big mess and I'd probably ended up lost in `timeout`! :confused:

Anyway, I showed _Type Letter_ around and one [colleague](https://twitter.com/guillaumechabot) of mine 
decided to ruin my life and came up with a new design. :lipstick:

##### Hope you like the game!
